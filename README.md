# calcuator-python

This project is a simple **command-line calculator** written in **Python**. It performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. 
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and a mathematical operator, then calculates and displays the result.

### **Key Features**

* **User Input**: The script takes three inputs from the user:
    * `a`: The first number.
    * `b`: The second number.
    * `operator`: The mathematical operator to be used (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
* **Arithmetic Operations**: The program supports the following operations:
    * `+`: Addition
    * `-`: Subtraction
    * `*`: Multiplication
    * `/`: Division
    * `%`: Modulo (remainder)
* **Conditional Logic**: It uses `if/elif/else` statements to check the entered operator and perform the corresponding calculation.
* **Error Handling**: If the user enters an invalid operator, the program prints an "Invalid Operator" message.
* **Output**: The final result of the calculation is printed to the console along with the name of the operation.
